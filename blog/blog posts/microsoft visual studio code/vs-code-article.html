            <p>Choosing the right code editor is one of the most important decisions a developer can make. A good editor improves productivity, 
            reduces errors, and makes coding more enjoyable. There are many popular options available today, including Sublime Text, Notepad++, 
            and Atom. However, after working with several tools, Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has become my editor of choice. In this blog post, 
            I’ll explain what Visual Studio Code is, why it stands out, and how its features and extensions can help both beginner and experienced developers 
            write better code.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started with Visual Studio Code</h2>
            <img src="VS-Code-Home-Screen.png" alt="Visual Studio Code Home Screen" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>When you first download and open Visual Studio Code, you are greeted with a clean and beginner-friendly welcome screen. From this screen, 
            you can create a new file, open an existing project, or clone a Git repository directly from GitHub. This makes VS Code especially appealing 
            to new developers who want to start coding quickly without complex setup.</p>
            
            <p>One of the first steps I recommend is signing in with your GitHub account. By clicking the gear icon in the lower-left
            corner and selecting the GitHub sign-in option, you can easily authenticate and clone repositories directly into VS
            Code. This tight integration saves time and encourages good version control habits from the start.</p>

            <p>Tip: Create a dedicated folder on your computer called “GitHub Repositories.” Using a single central location for your
            projects helps keep your work organized and easy to manage.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the VS Code Interface</h2>
            <p>On the left side of Visual Studio Code, you’ll find the Activity Bar, which provides quick access to essential tools.
            The default icons include Explorer, Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, and Extensions. As you install additional
            extensions, such as GitHub tools or language-specific dashboards, new icons may appear in this sidebar.</p>

            <p>For beginners, it’s important to avoid installing too many extensions at once. While extensions are powerful,
            downloading only what you need helps prevent clutter and confusion. If an extension no longer serves a purpose, it can
            easily be uninstalled.</p>

            <h2>Live Preview and Real-Time Feedback</h2>
            <img src="live-preview.png" alt="Visual Studio Code Live Preview Feature" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>One standout feature of Visual Studio Code is its ability to provide real-time feedback while coding. Using tools like
            Live Preview or Live Server, developers can instantly see how changes affect their application. By splitting the editor
            window, you can view your code on one side and the rendered output on the other.</p>

            <p>This live feedback loop is especially useful for front-end development, where visual accuracy matters. Seeing updates as
            you type helps identify layout issues, styling errors, and logic problems much faster than traditional refresh-based
            workflows.</p>
