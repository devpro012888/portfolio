            <p>Choosing the right code editor is one of the most important decisions a developer can make. A good editor improves productivity, 
            reduces errors, and makes coding more enjoyable. There are many popular options available today, including Sublime Text, Notepad++, 
            and Atom. However, after working with several tools, Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has become my editor of choice. In this blog post, 
            I’ll explain what Visual Studio Code is, why it stands out, and how its features and extensions can help both beginner and experienced developers 
            write better code.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started with Visual Studio Code</h2>
            <figure>

            <figcaption>Visual Studio Code Home Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When you first download and open Visual Studio Code, you are greeted with a clean and beginner-friendly welcome screen. From this screen, 
            you can create a new file, open an existing project, or clone a Git repository directly from GitHub. This makes VS Code especially appealing 
            to new developers who want to start coding quickly without complex setup.</p>
            
            <p>One of the first steps I recommend is signing in with your GitHub account. By clicking the gear icon in the lower-left
            corner and selecting the GitHub sign-in option, you can easily authenticate and clone repositories directly into VS
            Code. This tight integration saves time and encourages good version control habits from the start.</p>

            <p>Tip: Create a dedicated folder on your computer called “GitHub Repositories.” Using a single central location for your
            projects helps keep your work organized and easy to manage.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the VS Code Interface</h2>
            <p>On the left side of Visual Studio Code, you’ll find the Activity Bar, which provides quick access to essential tools.
            The default icons include Explorer, Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, and Extensions. As you install additional
            extensions, such as GitHub tools or language-specific dashboards, new icons may appear in this sidebar.</p>

            <p>For beginners, it’s important to avoid installing too many extensions at once. While extensions are powerful,
            downloading only what you need helps prevent clutter and confusion. If an extension no longer serves a purpose, it can
            easily be uninstalled.</p>

            <h2>Live Preview and Real-Time Feedback</h2>
            <figure>
            <img src="live-preview.png" alt="Visual Studio Code split view with HTML code and live browser preview">
            <figcaption>Split Screen Showing Code Editor and Live Preview</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>One standout feature of Visual Studio Code is its ability to provide real-time feedback while coding. Using tools like
            Live Preview or Live Server, developers can instantly see how changes affect their application. By splitting the editor
            window, you can view your code on one side and the rendered output on the other.</p>

            <p>This live feedback loop is especially useful for front-end development, where visual accuracy matters. Seeing updates as
            you type helps identify layout issues, styling errors, and logic problems much faster than traditional refresh-based
            workflows.</p>

            <h2>Extenstions: The True Power of VS Code</h2>
            <figure></figure>
            <img src="vs-code-extension-marketplace.png" alt="Visual Studio Code Extensions Marketplace with popular extensions">
            <figcaption>Visual Studio Code Extensions Marketplace</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Visual Studio Code truly shines through its extensive extension ecosystem. Extensions allow VS Code to adapt to your
            workflow rather than forcing you to adapt to the editor. Whether you are learning to code or managing large-scale
            applications, the right extensions can dramatically improve productivity and code quality.</p>

            <p>Prettier – Code Formatter is one of the most essential extensions available. It automatically formats your code on save,
            ensuring consistent indentation and styling across your project. This consistency improves readability and reduces
            unnecessary debates during code reviews.</p>

            <p>ESLint is another powerful tool that helps maintain high code quality. It analyzes JavaScript and TypeScript code in
            real time, highlighting potential bugs and bad practices before they become serious problems.</p>

            <p>For version control, GitLens enhances VS Code’s built-in Git features by showing who last modified a line of code, when
            it was changed, and which commit introduced it. This added context is invaluable when debugging or reviewing code.</p>

            <p>Additional productivity-focused extensions such as Live Server, Auto Rename Tag, REST Client, and visual tools like
            Material Icon Theme or Indent Rainbow further improve the development experience. AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot
            can also assist by generating boilerplate code and offering intelligent suggestions.</p>

            <h2>Debugging Made Simple</h2>
            <p>Debugging is an area where Visual Studio Code excels. Instead of relying solely on console logs, VS Code allows
            developers to set breakpoints, inspect variables in real time, and step through code line by line. This makes it easier
            to understand program flow and quickly identify the root cause of bugs.</p>

            <h2>Built-In Git Integration</h2>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Source Control panel in VS Code</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Visual Studio Code includes native Git support, allowing developers to manage version control without leaving the
            editor. From staging changes to committing updates and resolving merge conflicts, everything can be handled in one
            place. This seamless integration encourages frequent commits and better collaboration.</p>

            <h2>Customization and Productivity Features</h2>
            <p>VS Code offers extensive customization options, including themes, icon packs, and custom keybindings. Developers can
            even sync their settings across multiple devices to maintain a consistent workflow.</p>

            <p>Productivity features such as IntelliSense, integrated terminals, code snippets, and task automation help reduce context
            switching and keep developers focused. These tools make VS Code suitable for both small personal projects and large
            professional codebases.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>There are many excellent code editors available, but Microsoft Visual Studio Code stands out as a powerful, flexible,
            and beginner-friendly option. Its rich extension ecosystem, strong GitHub integration, and built-in productivity tools
            make it an ideal development environment.</p>

            <p>After using Visual Studio Code consistently, it has become my preferred editor for both learning and professional work.
            As I continue to grow as a developer, I plan to further explore its features and extensions to improve my workflow and
            coding efficiency.</p>
