                        <meta itemprop="author" content="Christopher E. White">I often ask myself an important question: Should 
                        students use AI tools while learning to program, or can they hinder real learning?</p>

                        <h2>Should Beginners Use AI to Learn Programming</h2
                        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> has quickly become a part of everyday life. From search engines like <strong>Google</strong>—now featuring AI-powered 
                        responses such as <strong>Gemini</strong>—to tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Copilot</strong>, AI is changing how we access information and solve problems.</p>

                        <p>As a self-taught developer learning web development through freeCodeCamp.org, I often ask myself an important question: Should 
                        students use AI tools while learning to program, or can they hinder real learning?</p>

                        <h2>How I Use AI in My Programming Projects</h2></h3>

                        <p>The short answer is yes—but with intention and balance.</p>

                        <p>I regularly use AI tools to assist with my programming projects, but I’m careful not to rely on them excessively. When used 
                          correctly, AI can act as a productivity booster and learning aid rather than a shortcut.</p>

                        <h3>How I Use AI in My Programming Projects</h3>

                        <p>One practical example comes from my website's <strong>Resume</strong> page. I list my military awards, but many visitors may not be 
                            familiar with what each award represents. To improve the user experience, I used <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to help generate <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
                            code that displays a tooltip when a user hovers over an award, providing a brief description.</p>

                        <p>By reviewing and understanding the code it generated, I was able to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement the feature successfully</li>
                            <li>Learn how tooltips work</li>
                            <li>Continue progressing on my project with confidence</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In addition, I frequently use <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio Code Copilot</strong></a> to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Generate repetitive code snippets</li>
                            <li>Improve code organization and readability</li>
                            <li>Speed up development without sacrificing understanding</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I've also used <strong>Visual Studio Code's AI chat feature</strong> for code reviews, refactoring suggestions, and
                            best-practice recommendations, which has helped me write cleaner and more maintainable code.
                        </p>

                        <h2>When Not to Use AI</h2>

                        <p>While AI is powerful, it should not replace foundational learning.  Relying on AI for every problem 
                            can limit critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
                        </p>

                        <p>Before turning to AI, I make it a habit to:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Research the problem on my own</li>
                            <li>Read documentation</li>
                            <li>Search forums like Stack Overflow</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>If I'm still stuck, I then use AI as a support tool, making sure to review and understand the solution 
                            so I can apply it independently in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                        <p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> can benefit both seasoned developers and beginners—if used responsibly.
                            It's not a replacement for learning, but rather a companion that can guide, explain, and accelerate progress. 
                        </p>

                        <p>As I continue my programming journey, I plan to use AI tools strategically—always prioritizing understanding over convenience.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thank you for reading!</p>

                        <p><em>Happy coding!</em></p>
