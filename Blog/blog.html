                    <h5>Exploring AI tools to enhance my web development journey<br>January 2, 2026</h5>
                    <article class="artificial-intelligence">
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has quickly become a part of everyday life. From search engines like Google—now featuring AI-powered 
                        responses such as Gemini—to tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, AI is changing how we access information and solve problems.</p>

                        <p>As a self-taught developer learning web development through freeCodeCamp.org, I often ask myself an important question: Should 
                        students use AI tools while learning to program, or can they hinder real learning?</p>

                        <h3>Should Beginners Use AI to Learn Programming</h3>

                        <p>The short answer is yes—but with intention and balance.</p>

                        <p>I regularly use AI tools to assist with my programming projects, but I’m careful not to rely on them excessively. When used 
                          correctly, AI can act as a productivity booster and learning aid rather than a shortcut.</p>

                        <h3>How I Use AI in My Programming Projects</h3>

                        <p>One practical example comes from my website's <b>Resume</b> page.  I list my military awards, but many visitors may not be 
                            familiar with what each award represents.  To improve the user experience, I used ChatGPT to help generate HTML and CSS
                            code that displays a tooltip when a user hovers over an award, providing a brief description.</p>

                        <p>By reviewing and understanding the code it generated, I was able to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement the feature successfully</li>
                            <li>Learn how tooltips work</li>
                            <li>Continue progressing on my project with confidence</li>
                        
                        
                        <p>Thank You for reading!</p>

                        <p>Happy coding!</p>

                    <h2>From Military to Software Engineer: My Journey Into Tech</h2>
                    <h5>Transition from Military Service to Software Engineering<br>December 15, 2025</h5>
                    <img class="mil-to-se-img" src="../Blog/Blog Posts/From Military to Sofware Engineer/military_to_se.png" alt="Military to Software Engineer" style="width:50%">
                    <article class="mil-to-se">
                        <p>Welcome to The Software Engineer’s Journal, and thank you for reading my very first blog post. My name is Christopher White, 
                        and I am currently serving on active duty in the United States Coast Guard. With over 17 years of military service, I’ve built a 
                        career rooted in discipline, leadership, and problem-solving—skills that translate naturally into the world of software engineering.</p>

                        <p>Throughout my Coast Guard career, I’ve worked extensively in administration, pay and personnel, and travel operations. While these 
                        roles may not seem technical on the surface, they required attention to detail, process improvement, and critical thinking—all of which 
                        align closely with software development.</p>

                        <p>My passion for technology, however, began long before my military service. Prior to enlisting, I earned an Associate Degree in Computer 
                        Information Systems from Atlantic Cape Community College, which laid the foundation for my interest in programming and IT.</p>

                        <p>While serving in the Coast Guard, I took full advantage of military Tuition Assistance to continue my education:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology – Purdue Global University</li>
                            <li>Master’s Degree in Information Technology, concentration in Software Development – Southern New Hampshire University</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>These programs strengthened my understanding of software concepts, systems design, and modern development practices, while reinforcing 
                            my goal of transitioning into a full-time software engineering role.</p>

                        <p>To further sharpen my hands-on skills, I am currently studying through freeCodeCamp.org, where I am working toward a Responsive Web 
                            Design Certification. Through this training, I am gaining practical experience building and designing websites using:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</li>
                                <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>This learning path is helping me bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world software development.</p>

                        <p>My long-term goal is to secure a position as a software engineer where I can continue learning, growing, and contributing to 
                            meaningful projects. While it may not be with a large tech company like Apple, Google, or Microsoft, I am committed to finding an 
                            organization that values curiosity, growth, and continuous improvement.</p>

                        <p>This blog will document my journey from military service to software engineering, including lessons learned, projects I’m working on, 
                        and insights for others considering a similar transition. If you’re a fellow service member, veteran, or aspiring developer, I hope my 
                        experiences help guide and motivate you.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for following along on my journey.</p>

                        <p>Happy coding!</p>
