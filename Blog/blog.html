                        <p class="blog-preview"> Welcome to The Software Engineers Journal, and thank you for reading my very first blog post. My name is Christopher White, 
                        and I am currently serving on active duty in the United States Coast Guard. With over 17 years of military service, I’ve built a 
                        career rooted in discipline, leadership, and problem-solving—skills that translate naturally into the world of software engineering.
